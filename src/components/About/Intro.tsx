          My career started as a web designer in 2009. Back in the days when
          photoshop reigned king, and slicing up .psd files was common practice.
          In mid 2015, I switched gears and went in all in with programming.
          Since then, Iâ€™ve been programming web interfaces and building API
          servers. For frontend work, I specialize in React (NextJS, JAMStack),
          and Go is my language of choice for anything server related.{' '}

          I've been a US expat since 2012 and currently reside in France. If you
          ever find yourself in the Paris region, let's grab a beer!{' '}
