title: "Learning How To Program"
---


Late last year, I decided to learn how to program. After reading Peter Norvig's essay *[Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)*, I knew that this was going to be a long, arduous journey; but a very rewarding one. 

With my main interests being in the web, naturally I chose [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) as my primary language. [Go](https://golang.org/) is also a language I would love to learn later on.

Approaching the programming realm can be very intimidating, especially if you are going at it alone. I live near Paris, so finding a Javascript meetup will probably be very helpful. Also, I've read countless times that finding a mentor helps tremendously. So if anyone out there is reading this and is an experienced Javascript developer, pls halp!

You are solving problems when you program, as such, I knew I should find some material on this subject.

> We've hired several devs out of bootcamp, and they're all taught how to code, but not how to solve problems using code...

The quote above was from this [thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13018560) on Hacker News. Some people recommended the following content for problem solving:

* [How to Design Programs](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html)
* [How to Solve it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It)
* [Design of Computer Programs](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212)
* [Clean Coders](https://cleancoders.com/videos/programming-101)


Since I am familiar with Matthias Felleisen, so I am going to be reading that book as I learn.


### Curriculum

There is no shortage of free learning material on the web. A lot of people steered me towards Udemy's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/), so I went with that one.

On top of that, I've done quite a bit of research and found the following courses & books appealing to me for learning Javascript.

To break things up a bit, I'm going to check out [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) to test my skills and be challenged on other various programming topics.

Since I want the scope of this post to be focused on the curriculum and material, I will stop here without getting to detailed.

I'll be posting updates on my progress so stay tuned!
